# Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project

This repository contains the files for the Coursera *Getting and Cleaning Data* course project.  
The goal of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.

## Overview

The data represent recordings from accelerometers on the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.  
The script `run_analysis.R` downloads the raw data, cleans it, and produces a tidy data set that can be used for later analysis.

## Files in this Repository

- **run_analysis.R** – the R script that performs all steps of data cleaning.
- **tidy_data.txt** – the tidy dataset produced by the script.
- **CodeBook.md** – explains the variables, data, and transformations performed.

## How to Run

1. Make sure R and the `dplyr` package are installed.
2. Save `run_analysis.R` in your working directory.
3. Run the script in R:
   ```r
   source("run_analysis.R")


#The script will:

1. Download and unzip the dataset.
2. Merge the training and test sets.
3. Extract only mean and standard deviation measurements.
4. Label activities and variables with descriptive names.
5. Create a tidy dataset tidy_data.txt containing the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

#Dependencies

1. R (version ≥ 3.6)
2. dplyr package

#Data Source

Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset
Available at: UCI Machine Learning Repository
