## Source of Data
This data comes from the **Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset**, available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The experiments were carried out with 30 volunteers performing six different activities (walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, and laying) while wearing a smartphone on their waist.

---

## Variables

- **subject** – ID of the subject (integer: 1–30)
- **activity** – Activity name (factor: WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING)

All other variables are numeric and represent the **average** of each measurement (mean or standard deviation) for each combination of subject and activity.

Examples include:
- `TimeBodyAccelerometerMeanX`
- `TimeBodyAccelerometerMeanY`
- `TimeBodyAccelerometerStdZ`
- `FrequencyBodyGyroscopeMeanX`
- `FrequencyBodyAccelerometerJerkStdY`
…and so on.

## Transformations

1. **Merge training and test datasets**
   - Combined `X_train`/`X_test`, `y_train`/`y_test`, and `subject_train`/`subject_test`.

2. **Extract only mean and standard deviation features**
   - Selected variables with names containing `mean()` or `std()`.

3. **Apply descriptive activity names**
   - Replaced activity codes (1–6) with activity labels from `activity_labels.txt`.

4. **Label variables with descriptive names**
   - Replaced abbreviations:
     - `t` → `Time`
     - `f` → `Frequency`
     - `Acc` → `Accelerometer`
     - `Gyro` → `Gyroscope`
     - `Mag` → `Magnitude`
     - Removed parentheses and dashes.

5. **Create a second tidy dataset**
   - Averaged each variable for each subject and each activity.
   - Output file: `tidy_data.txt`.

## Output

`tidy_data.txt` – a tidy dataset with 180 rows (30 subjects × 6 activities) and 68 columns.
